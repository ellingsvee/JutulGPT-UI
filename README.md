# JutulGPT-UI

JutulGPT-UI is a fork on the [Agent Chat UI](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-chat-ui) by LangGraph. It is a Next.js application which enables chatting with any LangGraph server with a `messages` key through a chat interface.


## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ellingsvee/JutulGPT-UI.git

cd JutulGPT-UI
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the app:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the app is running (or if using the deployed site), you'll be prompted to enter:

- **Deployment URL**: The URL of the LangGraph server you want to chat with. This can be a production or development URL.
- **Assistant/Graph ID**: The name of the graph, or ID of the assistant to use when fetching, and submitting runs via the chat interface.
- **LangSmith API Key**: (only required for connecting to deployed LangGraph servers) Your LangSmith API key to use when authenticating requests sent to LangGraph servers.

After entering these values, click `Continue`. You'll then be redirected to a chat interface where you can start chatting with your LangGraph server.

## SUGGESTED: Environment Variables

You can bypass the initial setup form by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:2024
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_ID=agent
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_...
```

To use these variables:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`
2. Fill in the values in the `.env` file
3. Restart the application

When these environment variables are set, the application will use them instead of showing the setup form.

## Going to Production (copied from the original repo)

Once you're ready to go to production, you'll need to update how you connect, and authenticate requests to your deployment. By default, the Agent Chat UI is setup for local development, and connects to your LangGraph server directly from the client. This is not possible if you want to go to production, because it requires every user to have their own LangSmith API key, and set the LangGraph configuration themselves.

### Production Setup

To productionize the Agent Chat UI, you'll need to pick one of two ways to authenticate requests to your LangGraph server. Below, I'll outline the two options:

### Quickstart - API Passthrough

The quickest way to productionize the Agent Chat UI is to use the [API Passthrough](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough) package. This package provides a simple way to proxy requests to your LangGraph server, and handle authentication for you.

This repository already contains all of the code you need to start using this method. The only configuration you need to do is set the proper environment variables.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_ID="agent"
# This should be the deployment URL of your LangGraph server
LANGGRAPH_API_URL="https://my-agent.default.us.langgraph.app"
# This should be the URL of your website + "/api". This is how you connect to the API proxy
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="https://my-website.com/api"
# Your LangSmith API key which is injected into requests inside the API proxy
LANGSMITH_API_KEY="lsv2_..."
```

Let's cover what each of these environment variables does:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_ID`: The ID of the assistant you want to use when fetching, and submitting runs via the chat interface. This still needs the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix, since it's not a secret, and we use it on the client when submitting requests.
- `LANGGRAPH_API_URL`: The URL of your LangGraph server. This should be the production deployment URL.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: The URL of your website + `/api`. This is how you connect to the API proxy. For the [Agent Chat demo](https://agentchat.vercel.app), this would be set as `https://agentchat.vercel.app/api`. You should set this to whatever your production URL is.
- `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`: Your LangSmith API key to use when authenticating requests sent to LangGraph servers. Once again, do _not_ prefix this with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` since it's a secret, and is only used on the server when the API proxy injects it into the request to your deployed LangGraph server.

For in depth documentation, consult the [LangGraph Next.js API Passthrough](https://www.npmjs.com/package/langgraph-nextjs-api-passthrough) docs.

### Advanced Setup - Custom Authentication

Custom authentication in your LangGraph deployment is an advanced, and more robust way of authenticating requests to your LangGraph server. Using custom authentication, you can allow requests to be made from the client, without the need for a LangSmith API key. Additionally, you can specify custom access controls on requests.

To set this up in your LangGraph deployment, please read the LangGraph custom authentication docs for [Python](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/auth/getting_started/), and [TypeScript here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/auth/custom_auth/).

Once you've set it up on your deployment, you should make the following changes to the Agent Chat UI:

1. Configure any additional API requests to fetch the authentication token from your LangGraph deployment which will be used to authenticate requests from the client.
2. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable to your production LangGraph deployment URL.
3. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_ID` environment variable to the ID of the assistant you want to use when fetching, and submitting runs via the chat interface.
4. Modify the [`useTypedStream`](src/providers/Stream.tsx) (extension of `useStream`) hook to pass your authentication token through headers to the LangGraph server:

```tsx
const streamValue = useTypedStream({
  apiUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  assistantId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_ID,
  // ... other fields
  defaultHeaders: {
    Authentication: `Bearer ${addYourTokenHere}`, // this is where you would pass your authentication token
  },
});
```
